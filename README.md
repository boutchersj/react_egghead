Egghead.io's "The Beginner's Guide to React" video tutorials

I'm using Egghead.io as a second resource to learn React after having gone through freeCodeCamp's React, Redux, and React/Redux challenges. I found that I was still fairly boggled by all the new information after I went through freeCodeCamp's material, but I did take away some key elements, which is enough for me to build on here with Egghead's tutorials.

I'm hoping to gain a more intricate understanding of React from these video tutorials. I want to know how React works under the hood, and it seems that's the approach this tutorial takes, breaking it apart and beginning with the Vanilla.js versions of all the React functionality so it's easier to understand how everything works once it's all converted to JSX. I plan to use this as a way to understand React well enough to build my first React project in freeCodeCamp, the Random Quote Generator.
